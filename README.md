## Language
Choosen development language choice is JAVA.<br/>

Reasons : <br/>
-Greater development experience with this language.<br/>
-More common language and therefore more likely to be understood by a majority of developers.<br/>
-Many historical Open Source libraries compatible Java are not necessarily with Kotlin.<br/>
-The Java community is much more widespread than kotlin.<br/>
-There will be less risk of future maintenance with Java due to its completion compared to Kotlin which is relatively younger and faster to evolve.<br/>
